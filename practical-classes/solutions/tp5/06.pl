/*

    The cut in imature acts as a negation, a predicate not. 
    If X is an adult then imature fails, else it suceeds. 
    It is a red cut because it is essencial for the program and changes the result.

    The cut in adult avoids exploring all the search space, because X is either a turtle or a person.
    It is a green cut because it does not change the program outcome but makes it more efficient.
